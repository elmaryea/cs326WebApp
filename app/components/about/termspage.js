        16. User Services
      </h2>
      <p>
        Upon the Buyer awarding a project or contest to the Seller, and the Seller's acceptance on the Website, or the purchase of an item by a Buyer from the Seller, the Buyer and Seller will be deemed to have entered into a User Contract under which the Buyer agrees to purchase, and the Seller agrees to deliver the Seller Services. You agree not to enter into any contractual provisions in conflict with the User Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with your obligations to other Users. If you do not, you may become liable to that User. You must ensure that you are aware of any domestic laws (including common law), international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations relevant to you as a Buyer or Seller, or in any other uses you make of the Website.
      </p>
      <p>
        If another User breaches any obligation to you, you are solely responsible for enforcing any rights that you may have. For the avoidance of doubt, we have no responsibility for enforcing any rights under a User Contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on their jurisdiction, Sellers and Buyers may have rights under statutory warranties that cannot lawfully be excluded. Nothing in this User Agreement is intended to override a right that by applicable law may not be excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each User acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between Buyers and Sellers is that of an independent contractor. Nothing in this User Agreement creates a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment relationship between Users. Nothing in this User Agreement shall in any way be construed as forming a joint venture, partnership or an employer-employee relationship between Freelancer and the User.

        Each User acknowledges
      </p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          Freelancer may from time to time include a map feature and Freelancer may display the location of Users to persons browsing the Website on that map. Every Buyer seeking services for Local jobs will be asked to provide the location where the Local job is to be performed or the goods are to be delivered. A User must never disclose, in any Project posted, personal details such as the User's name, street number, phone number or the email address in any Project description for a Local job or in any other public communication on the Freelancer Website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once a Seller's bid has been accepted by a Buyer seeking Local jobs services or tasks then the Seller providing the service or task is obliged to complete the transaction, unless the service or task, goods or transaction is prohibited by law, by this Agreement or by any of our Policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a Buyer updates a Local job after it has been published on the Website, then all bids for that Local job made prior to the update will be automatically cancelled and the bidding process will restart. When a Seller has provided the goods or services or completed the task requested by a Buyer seeking services for Local job, the User must log on to the Website and click the "Complete" button for that Local job. Failure to complete the service or task will constitute a breach of this User Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our fees are applied to the amount of the awarded Seller's bid to perform the services for the Local job. Any items purchased by the Seller as part of performing the service are between the Buyer and Seller.

        18. Funds
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may have funds in your Account if you have prepaid for fees or charges or for services to be provided to you via the Website. If you are a Seller, you may have funds if you have successfully completed a Project, or sold an item, and funds have been released to you. There are also circumstances where funds will have been credited to your Account in relation to an affiliate program or a referral program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Funds in your Account are held by us in our operating accounts held with reputable financial institutions. Funds in your Account are not held separately by us and may be commingled with our general operating funds and funds of other User's Accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are not entitled to any interest, or other earnings for funds that are in your Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may receive interest on funds held by us in our operating accounts (which may include funds in your Account) from financial institutions with whom we hold our operating accounts. Any such interest earned belongs to us and we will not be liable to any User for any imputed interest on such funds.

        <li>
          set-off the negative amount of funds with funds that you subsequently receive into your Account;
        </li>
        <li>
          if you have funds in multiple currencies in your Account and one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, we may set-off the negative amount against funds you maintain in a different currency balance (at an exchange rate applied by us);
        </li>
        <li>
          reverse payments you have made from your Account to other User Accounts on the Website;

          immediately suspend or limit your Account until such time as your Account no longer has a negative amount.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In the event that we offset a negative amount of funds pursuant to this section, it may be bundled with another debit coming out of your Account.

        We reserve the right to collect any funds owed to us by any other legal means.

          funds may only loaded into your Account, or released from your Account, by us and you must only use the mechanisms available on the Website to pay for, or receive funds in respect of Seller Services;
        </li>
        <li>
          we will hold funds in respect of the amount of your Account (including Milestone Payments) in an account held by us with a financial institution (or in any manner that we decide in our sole discretion from time to time) and such funds are not segregated into a separate account; and

      <h2>
        19. Limits & Fraud Prevention
      </h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend a User withdrawal request if the source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we become aware that any funds received into an Account from another Account as a result of a fraudulent transaction (e.g. paid a Milestone Payment using a stolen credit card) it will be reversed immediately. If those funds have already been released to you, you must pay the funds into your Account. If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit or cancel your account, or take action against you to recover those funds.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all of the funds in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the funds) if:
      </p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject to reversal or chargeback;
        </li>
        <li>
          we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other than you;
        </li>
        <li>
          we believe that the payment is being made to a country where we do not offer our Service; or
        </li>
        <li>
          we are required to do so by law.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain circumstances) place a temporary limit on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in your favour, we will lift the limit on your funds and those funds may be released to you. If the dispute is not resolved in your favour, we may remove the funds from your Account.
      </p>
      <h2>
        20. Refunds
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may ask for a refund at any time for any funds that you have paid into your Account except if the amount to refund relates to a Milestone Payment or relates to fees or charges payable to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the amount the User has asked to refund relates to: (1) a Milestone Payment, the Dispute Resolution Process may be followed; or (2) our fees and charges, the process set out in the Clause "Disputes with Us" must be followed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User via the same payment method(s) that the User used to make the original payment to us. We may, in our sole discretion, use an alternative payment method in exceptional circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User has requested funds be refunded if: (1) we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so; (2) we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs; (3) we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to time; (4) we find out that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent; (5) the User made a duplicate payment in error; or (6) we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can request a refund by using our <a href="/users/helpdesk">customer support website</a> or emailing us at <a href="mailto:supprot@freelancer.com">support@freelancer.com</a>. If you have done so, you must not initiate a chargeback request with your credit card issuer until such time as all reasonable efforts have been exhausted with us to resolve your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have already initiated a chargeback request with your credit card issuer, you must not request a refund of funds by contacting us and must not seek double recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you have made an excessive or unreasonable number of requests to refund funds back to you or chargebacks, we may suspend, limit or close your Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no minimum amount for a refund.
      </p>
      <h2>
        21. Withdrawals
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your first withdrawal of funds earned will be delayed for fifteen days for security and fraud purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequent withdrawals may be delayed for up to fifteen days where our fraud prevention policies dictate that a delay is required.

      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover chargebacks and reversals that may be imposed on us by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on funds paid to you by Buyers through the Website.

      </p>
      <p>
        If we close your Account for a reason other than as a result of your breach of this User Agreement, unless as otherwise specified in this User Agreement, you will be entitled to receive any payment due from us to you.

        If a dispute arises between you and Freelancer, our goal is to address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a means of resolving the dispute quickly. We strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by using our <a href="/users/helpdesk">customer support website</a> or emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@freelancer.com">support@freelancer.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any claim, Freelancer may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. If Freelancer elects arbitration, such arbitration will be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider, which is to be selected by you from a panel of ADR providers that Freelancer will provide to you. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        All claims you bring against Freelancer must be resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Agreement shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of this Agreement. Should you file a claim contrary to the terms of this Agreement, Freelancer may recover its legal fees and costs (including in-house lawyers and paralegals), provided that Freelancer has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, Freelancer will be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Freelancer's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
      </p>
      <h2>
        30. Currencies
      </h2>
      <p>
        Some of the Websites will display rates in the local currency of that Website, in addition to the actual amount. These rates are based on a conversion from the originating currency using indicative market exchange rates. You understand and agree that these rates are only indicative and the amount specified in the origin currency is the actual amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a convenience service, you may withdraw funds from the Website in another currency. If you wish to do so, you will be quoted an exchange rate which will be available for the time specified, which you may choose to accept. We may charge a fee for effecting the currency conversion transactions. This fee will be embedded within the rate provided to you and the currency exchange will be settled immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to reject any request for a conversion of currency at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for all risks associated with converting and maintaining funds in various available currencies, including but not limited to the risk that the value of these funds will fluctuate as exchange rates change, which could result in decreases in the value of your funds in aggregate. You must not use (or attempt to use) the Website to engage in speculative trading, which could result in substantial losses. We are not a financial services provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        All information included on the Website in respect of currency conversion is general information only. Use of currency conversion is at your own risk. Currency conversions are final and irreversible.
      </p>
      <h2>
        31. Competitions
      </h2>
      <p>
        We may run and promote competitions on the Website from time to time and such competitions will be subject to the terms and conditions as published by us on the Website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prizes awarded will be denominated in USD unless stated otherwise. Competition winners will be determined by us in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions at our absolute discretion. All decisions made us in respect of competition are final and we will not enter into any correspondence in relation to the prize or the promotion.
      </p>
      <h2>
        32. Contests
      </h2>
      <p>
        Buyers can promote a Contest hosted on the Website by providing a Contest Brief and paying the Contest Prize in accordance to our instructions provided on the Website. A Buyer which promotes a Contest acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for the operation and promotion of the Contest and warrants that it will comply with all applicable law in respect of the operation and promotion of the Contest. We have no liability for loss suffered by a User in connection with a Contest including but not limited to loss suffered (or penalties imposed) in connection with a contravention of law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entrants may submit their entries in image, video, text or other format as specified on the Website. All entries must comply with the Contest Brief and must not infringe any Intellectual Property Rights. Any entry which infringes any Intellectual Property Rights will be an ineligible entry and subject to removal either by the Buyer or us and subject to action as per our <a href="/dmca">Copyright Infringement Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buyers can promote either: (1) a regular prepaid Contest, under which a Buyer may select one or more winning Entrant(s) and Buyers may request that the Contest Prize be released to them if a winner has not been chosen within 30 days of the contest closing date; or (2) a guaranteed Contest, under which a Buyer may select one or more winning Seller(s) and if no winner is selected, we will release the Contest Prize to Entrants of the guaranteed Contest and charge the appropriate fees and the Buyer will have no rights to have the Contest Prize released to them or to use any entries that have been submitted. After 30 days of the contest closing date, we reserve the right to distribute the contest prize to the participating freelancers.
      </p>
      <p>
        After awarding a Contest Prize, the Buyer and winning Entrant(s) will enter into a Contest Handover and when the winning Entrant(s) has uploaded the winning entry (including all related files) to the Buyer, the Contest Prize will be released to the winner of the Contest unless disputed by the Buyer in which case the dispute must be resolved between the Buyer and winning Entrant(s) before we can release the Contest Prize to the winning Entrant(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        For avoidance of doubt, the Buyer has no right or licence to use any entries other than the winning entry/entries. The Buyer may not: (1) promote a Contest via the Website if the Buyer is hosting a similar contest through another service; (2) allow or request Sellers to submit entries to the Buyer via other means than the Website; and (3) award another Account that might be deemed as collusion or awarding another Account owned by the Buyer.
      </p>
      <h2>

        40. No Warranty As To Each User's Purported Identity
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because User identification on the internet is difficult, we cannot and do not confirm each User's purported identity. We may provide information about a User, such as a strength or risk score, geographical location, or third party background check or verification of identity or credentials. However, such information is based solely on data that the User submits and we provide such information solely for the convenience of Users and the provision of such information is not an introduction, endorsement or recommendation by us.
