      <p>
        You can update your information through your account profile settings. If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it.

      <p>
        Additionally, You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto: privacy@freelancer.com">privacy@freelancer.com</a>. Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try to provide you with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you). We may charge you a fee to cover our administrative and other reasonable costs in providing the information to you. We will not charge for simply making the request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information.
      </p> 
      <p>
        There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold.
